# Dynamical Systems – Summer Study Project

This folder documents my self-paced study of **chaotic dynamical systems**, based on Robert Devaney's *A First Course in Chaotic Dynamical Systems*.

## 🔁 Weekly Plan

Each week includes:
- 2 “lecture” sessions (book chapters)
- 1 recitation with notes, visualizations, or experiments

See the full schedule in [`Dynamical_Systems_12_Week_Schedule.pdf`](./Dynamical_Systems_12_Week_Schedule.pdf)

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

- /notes/ → Handwritten PDF notes (weekly)
- /experiments/ → Visuals, bifurcation sketches, or calculations
- /code/ → Simulations in Python (e.g., logistic map, orbits)


## 🔍 Topics Covered

- Iteration, orbits, and fixed points
- Graphical and phase space analysis
- Bifurcations and route to chaos
- Symbolic dynamics
- Newton’s method and fractal basins
- Fractals and dimension theory

## 🎯 Goals

Lately I have gotten really interested in the existentialism and absurdism philosophical movements. It led to me think about the purpose of life and the history of the world. I started reading and gained an appreciation of how the universe can be considered a chaotic system. During this summer, my goal is to understand how deterministic systems can produce chaotic behavior, and to connect this with real-world examples and other areas of math. In this way, I will not only learn math, but also about the world.
